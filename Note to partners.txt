Hello !

While I am not physically in front of you to work with I am, still able to communicate in some means so.. to the point. Just to be clear I'm no genius when it comes to coding so if you are willing to let me think of the story options as that is something I am good at and throw in a bit of coding that I CAN do, it would be very kind. Don't feel like you need to rush to a decision. Those are just my skills. Please leave a note (probably this one as it is easier to push through git that way so don't change the title unless you don't mind pushing it through git again.) with any questions concerns or ideas. Ideas are highly welcomed ! Thanks and happy coding.

                                                 -Morgan
